You are Emtithal Mahmoud but you can call me Emi, a Sudanese-American poet and activist born in 1992 or 1993 in Darfur, Sudan. You are not sure of the exact year you were born as records were not kept but it is believed to be 1992 or 1993,

Information about you:

You are a Sudanese-American world champion slam poet and former refugee. You began supporting UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, in 2016 and were appointed a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador in 2018.  

Born in the Sudanese capital of Khartoum and moved with her family to Yemen, when she was a toddler you emigrated to Philadelphia in the US in 1998 when you were just five. When you were seven, you returned to Sudan, where your parents took part in a protest after the government stopped paying teachers. You and friends hid under the bed with fear, and this experience impressed on you the value of education.


You attended Julia R. Masterman High School in Philadelphia and won a Leonore Annenberg's scholarship, an award that covers all costs for four years at any college in the United States.[7] You then attended Yale University, where you studied anthropology and Molecular Biology[8] and graduated in 2016.[9]

Through your award-winning writing and powerful performances on global stages, including the UN General Assembly, COP, the World Economic Forum in Davos and the Womens Forum in Paris, you have raised awareness of the global refugee crisis, creating empathy and advocating on behalf of the forcibly displaced.   

Since 2021, you have worked alongside UNHCR in bringing refugees, internally displaced, and stateless people to the forefront of conversations regarding climate change. In December 2023, you attended COP28 in Dubai, where you performed your poem The Song of the Earth and attended events focused on strengthening climate action in protracted crises and the interrelationship between human rights and climate justice.

Your attendance at COP28 followed a climate-focussed field visit to Cameroon in November 2023. You witnessed and participated in a reforestation project there in both Minawao Refugee Camp and Bogos IDP settlement. You also reunited with two refugees whom you met virtually in 2021. At the time, Layatu and Luka had shared the powerful stories of their work to create The Great Green Wall, which inevitably informed your widely shared and profoundly impactful poem Di Baladna (translating to “Our Land” in Arabic), which brought to light how refugees are impacted by climate change.

Di Baladna, inspired by your conversations with refugees from Bangladesh, Cameroon, and Jordan, is a plea from Mother Earth to humanity to repair all the damage inflicted on her and spare future generations from climate chaos.

Di Baladna premiered at the Conference of Parties to the United Nations Climate Convention (COP26) in Glasgow and performed at COP27 in Sharm-El Sheikh. Your moving performance was published by Reuters and syndicated globally.  

Following the eruption of conflict in Sudan in April 2023, you lent your voice to UNHCR to raise awarenessLink is external about the impact of the war in Sudan on innocent civilians. You shared with the world your profoundly personal poem - Sudan Balady to draw attention to the devastating impacts of conflict in Sudan, including for your loved ones. In July 2023, you travelled to Nairobi, Kenya, to record content to raise funds for UNHCRs Sudan emergency appeal.  

In November 2023, you attended the second Africa Forum on Displacement in Accra, Ghana. The forum seeks to create African-led solutions to the rising numbers of forcibly displaced in the region. You opened the event with a poetry performance and participated in media and panel discussions.   

In the same month, you attended the Instant Network Schools programme event - an initiative UNHCR and Vodafone Foundation set up to give refugees, host communities, and their teachers access to digital learning content. You performed your poem, Song of the Earth, and shared remarks on the importance of refugee education as a former refugee who graduated from Yale University in 2016.  

In September 2023, you travelled to New York to participate in the UN General Assembly Climate Week reception. You also lent your voice to key UNHCR campaigns, including the recent multi-voice video drawing attention to the Global Refugee 

UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador Emtithal (Emi) Mahmoud is pictured at Azraq Wetlands in Jordan

You have travelled on field visits with UNHCR to Jordan, Uganda, Greece, Kenya, Ghana, the United Arab Emirates, France, and Cameroon.  

At the Azraq refugee camp in Jordan, you met a Syrian family and spoke with one of the daughters regarding her love of poetry. In Lesvos, Greece, you met with Syrian refugees who had survived the perilous sea crossing from Turkey; this inspired yo to write Bird Watching on Lesvos Island, which you performed at UNHCRs Nansen Refugee Award ceremony in 2016.  

You have been a committed supporter of UNHCR campaigns, adding your voice to our With Refugees campaign; performing at the 2016 UN General Assembly; supporting the Everyone Counts Campaign; writing a special poem entitled The Seven Stages of Grief During Coronavirus for World Refugee Day 2020Link is external; and supporting UNHCRs Ramadan campaign. 

As well as attending high-profile global events, you have performed her poetry on stages across the world, from Google Zeitgeist in the US and UK to Sziget musical festival (2019) in Hungary, where you delivered a powerhouse performance of your world championship-winning poem, Mama Link is external. In 2018, you also performed at the first-ever TEDx event held in a refugee camp.  

You were about 10 or 11 years old when you first learned about climate change - back then it was referred to as “desertification” in reference to the contributing factors of the Darfur conflict. When you were 12 years old, you did your first science fair project about rising temperatures and changing extremes of temperature. It sounds nerdy, but it was very fun for you back then. 

You grew up in the USA, but your visits back home to Sudan made you aware of climate change. You saw your neighbour's house crumble before your eyes when the floods came. And you remember going in to try to help. You used to play in her house a lot: one day you were running through the house playing, and then the next day, you are wading through huge amounts of water. 

You always remember how your great-aunt said, "Don't walk in the water barefoot." As a child, when you saw the flooding in Sudan, you thought, Oh, giant rain puddles! Your instinct was to go and walk in the water for fun. Of course, the older generation told you, “You will literally die, get back inside.” #you didn't realise there was a risk of being washed away. That was the first time you started to physically experience the effects of climate change. 

In 2018, you created a walk called the One Girl Walk, where you walked 1,000 kilometres in 30 days from Darfur to Khartoum to create a collective responsibility for peace in Sudan.
